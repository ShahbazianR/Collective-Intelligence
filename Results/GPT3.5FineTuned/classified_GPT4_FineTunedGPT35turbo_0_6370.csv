The affected components, specifically the com.mediatek.mtklogger.framework.LogReceiver and com.mediatek.mtklogger.framework.MTKLoggerService, are exported by default and are accessible to any application on the device due to an intent filter, lack of custom permission protection, and failure to explicitly set the android:exported attribute to false. Attack vectors include the use of android.content.Intent object for communication to start and stop the logs, which contain sensitive user data such as GPS coordinates, outgoing and incoming calls, text messages, and network captures.

The impact of this vulnerability is severe as it allows a third-party app to modify the /data/system/users/0/settings_secure.xml file to add an app as a notification listener, thereby gaining access to the text of notifications as they arrive on the device.

CVE-2020-15566,"An incorrect error handling issue in Xen through 4.13.x, affecting all architectures, causes a host OS crash when an event-channel port allocation fails. This problem arises due to the software's inability to correctly identify and handle errors when the allocation of an event-channel port fails for reasons other than the port being already in use. This includes scenarios where the memory allocation fails, or the port being allocated is higher than what is supported by the ABI used by the guest or the limit set by an administrator. This vulnerability can be exploited by guest OS users, particularly when the administrator has configured a guest to allow more than 1023 event channels, or when Xen is out-of-memory, leading to a host crash instead of reporting an error. Xen versions 4.10 and later are affected. However, the default configuration, when guests are created with xl/libxl, is not vulnerable due to the default event-channel limit.","av: L, ac: L, pr: L, ui: N, s: C, c: N, i: H, a: H",L,L,L,N,C,N,H,H

This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-38492, affects all Kirby content management system sites with user accounts, unless Kirby's API and Panel are disabled in the config. The issue arises from the fact that Kirby's authentication endpoint did not limit the password length, allowing attackers to provide a password up to the server's maximum request body length. Validating such a long password requires more CPU and memory resources, potentially causing the website to become unresponsive or unavailable. 

Despite Kirby's built-in brute force protection limiting the impact of this vulnerability to 10 failed logins from each IP address and 10 failed logins for each existing user per hour, it is recommended to update to one of the patched releases (Kirby 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6).

The installer sets the C:\Sage\Sage300\Runtime directory as the first entry in the system-wide PATH environment variable but fails to set explicit permissions, causing it to inherit weak permissions from the C:\ folder. This vulnerability allows an attacker to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM by exploiting the search order for DLLs. If the Global Search or Web Screens functionality is enabled, the GlobalSearchService and Sage.CNA.WindowsService services can also be exploited for privilege escalation due to the same DLL search-order hijacking. This is because unprivileged users have modify permissions on the application directory. Although older versions of the software default to installing in %PROGRAMFILES(X86)% (which would allow the Sage folder to inherit strong permissions, making the installation not vulnerable), the official Sage 300 installation guides for those versions recommend installing in C:\Sage, which would make the installation vulnerable.","av: N, ac: L, pr: L, ui: N, s: U, c: H, i: H, a: H",N,L,L,N,U,H,H,H
