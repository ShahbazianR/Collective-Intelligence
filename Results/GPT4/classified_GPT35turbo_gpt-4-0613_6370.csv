CVE-2021-32685,"VULNERABILITY: Improper Signature Verification in tEnvoyNaClSigningKey Component leads to Message Forgery in tEnvoy

DESCRIPTION: Improper handling of signatures in the `verifyWithMessage` method of the `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` class in tEnvoy allows for message forgery attacks. Prior to version 7.0.3, the method always returns `true` for any signature with a SHA-512 hash matching the message's SHA-512 hash, even if the signature is invalid. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to forge messages and potentially bypass authentication mechanisms.

IMPACT: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to forge messages, leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other malicious activities within the affected system. This could result in a breach of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information.

SOFTWARE COMPONENTS AFFECTED: tEnvoy library versions prior to 7.0.3 are affected by this vulnerability. The library includes PGP, NaCl, and PBKDF2 functionalities in node.js and the browser, commonly used by TogaTech.org.

ATTACK VECTOR: An attacker can craft a malicious message with a manipulated signature that matches the SHA-512 hash of the message. By exploiting the improper signature verification in the `verifyWithMessage` method, the attacker can trick the system into accepting the forged message as authentic, leading to potential security breaches.

RECOMMENDATION: Users and administrators are advised to update to tEnvoy version 7.0.3 or later to mitigate this vulnerability. Additionally, as a workaround, it is recommended to modify the `verifyWithMessage` method in `tenvoy.js` to ensure that the return statement call to `this.verify` ends in `.verified` for proper signature verification.","av: N

CVE-2023-46232,"Vulnerability CVE-2023-46232 involves a bug in the era-compiler-vyper software component used in zkSync Era, a layer 2 rollup solution for Ethereum that utilizes zero-knowledge proofs for scalability. Prior to version 1.3.10 of era-compiler-vyper, a flaw existed that prevented the proper initialization of the first immutable variable in Vyper contracts under specific conditions. This issue occurs when a String or Array in the contract has more allocated 256-bit words than initialized, resulting in the second word's index being unset and effectively set to 0. As a consequence, the first immutable value with the actual 0 index is overwritten in the ImmutableSimulator.

The vulnerability can be exploited through a malicious contract that allocates a significant amount of uninitialized space, such as `String[4096]`. By taking advantage of this bug, an attacker could potentially manipulate the immutable variables in affected contracts, leading to unexpected behavior or security risks.

To mitigate this issue, users are advised to upgrade to version 1.3.10 of era-compiler-vyper and redeploy any affected contracts. Failure to address this vulnerability could result in increased costs and potential security implications for Ethereum applications utilizing zkSync Era.","av: N

AFFECTED COMPONENTS: Xen versions through 4.13.x on x86 Intel systems

IMPACT: Host OS denial of service or privilege escalation

ATTACK VECTOR: Malicious x86 Intel HVM guest OS users can exploit the vulnerability by causing insufficient cache write-back under VT-d, leading to retained read/write DMA access to frames returned to Xen's free pool. This can result in host crashes (Denial of Service) and potential privilege escalation. The issue arises when page tables are shared between IOMMU and CPU, requiring flushing of both TLBs. Changes to page tables may not properly write back cached data, especially when splitting large page mappings into smaller granularity ones.

CVE-2023-30549,"Use-after-free vulnerability in ext4 filesystem in Apptainer versions < 1.1.0 and installations with apptainer-suid < 1.1.8 on certain older operating systems allows attackers to exploit the kernel for denial of service and potentially for privilege escalation. The vulnerability affects systems running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, Debian 10 buster (without linux-5.10 package), Ubuntu 18.04 bionic, and Ubuntu 20.04 focal. By default, Apptainer 1.1.8 disables mounting extfs filesystem types in setuid-root mode, while still allowing non-setuid ""rootless"" mode using fuse2fs. Workarounds include not installing apptainer-suid or setting `allow setuid = no` in apptainer.conf, with the latter option requiring unprivileged user namespaces enabled. Another workaround is to use `limit containers` options in apptainer.conf/singularity.conf to restrict sif files to trusted users/groups/paths and set `allow container extfs = no` to prevent mounting extfs overlay files.","av: L
